          <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p class="bio-p1">Little me had dreams of growing into some sort of rock star astronaut.  I haven't come close to becoming the sort of one-woman <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/grusk?src=hash&lang=en" class="hero-bold" target="_blank">Grusk</a> my childhood self intended to be.  Still, I never lost my determination to connect with people, create things of value, and be a force for good in the world.  You may be wondering, given the nature of the dreams I've always had, why I chose to enter the design field.  You might be curious what qualities I possess that make me well-suited to the work.</p>
                <p class="bio-p2">From a very early age, I was pulled aside at school and given the privileges of a child with special gifts.  My classmate Ben and I were made to sit inside and play computer games during recess.  To his credit, he did not think about what he was missing out on by not playing with the other kids!  He often took the helm as we played our games on the same computer, and he is a successful computer scientist now.  I struggled to find the confidence to even take a turn, and worried about making friends.  Still, I knew I would find my right place someday – and made a commitment to lifelong learning.  One way in which I excelled early was in written communication.  I won several contests for my poetry and stories, and I continue to develop my writing practice today.  It is a way to communicate ideas, express myself creatively, and to process information on the way to solving problems.  I always have a notebook with me.</p>
                <p class="bio-p3">I learned about taking risks and presenting myself confidently in the face of criticism while studying music in college.  I expanded upon this, and also learned to confront sexism, during subsequent years spent immersed in the Chicago local music scene.  At my day job at an outpatient clinic for new cancer patients, I spent hours listening to clients on the phone - developing empathy and learning how to build and honor trust along the way.  I learned to be accurate and to mind the details during my work in service contracts.  I had to be effective as a collaborator, and needed to negotiate conflicts between departments with competing interests, during my work as a publishing coordinator.  All of these experiences helped me to learn and grow, but I knew I could do more.  In fact, I needed to do more.  I owed it to my young self to try to explore some of the potential I may have had before life carried me away with all of it's responsibilities and other distractions.</p>
                <p class="bio-p4">
                  As a fortune cookie once said, "In order to remain young, one must change."  In 2018 I began my intensive study of user experience design and front-end development.  My efforts are ongoing, and when I do finally succeed I will know exactly why.  I can bring all of this and more to your projects.</p>

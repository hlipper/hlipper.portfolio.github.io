  <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>In a crowded market, how can a new cloud storage platform best make an impact?  Tapping into an unanticipated
        need would prove to be key to the creation of Winder.  We discovered that individual audio collections, whether
        composed of music, podcasts, film scores, or other audio recordings are actually deeply personal catalogs of a
        lifetime of potent memories and hard-won knowledge.  Our goal was to provide a space for these files to take on
        a life of their own, where they can coalesce and transform into new ideas and memories - unimpeded by the
        interference of recommended listening.</p>

          <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Our client came to us with the tools to develop a file storage platform, and hoped to build in social features
            to help drive growth.  The biggest question looming at the start of this project was, what can we offer that isn’t
            currently being provided by other products?  What users are left wanting more by existing products, and why?
            What purpose, content, and features would attract these individuals to a fresh take on cloud storage?   The task
            was to conduct research and testing, to design process flows and visuals, to create both content and brand strategies,
            and to build prototypes suitable for use as templates for the development team.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="solution">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Our competitive analysis revealed that most cloud storage platforms weren’t effectively addressing audio file
              storage needs, while most audio streaming services weren’t providing users with the functionality of a cloud
              storage platform.  A full 66% of survey respondents stated they would be interested in a storage solution for their
              audio files, as the product they currently use for other file types isn’t adequately addressing this need.  Here
              are examples of sources of audio files a user may want to store, which are not accounted for by most streaming services.
              These items were kept in mind, and prioritized by popularity, when the product concept was being developed.</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p class="user-research-p1">Early surveys revealed that the demographic most likely to be interested in this product is between 18 and 45 years
                of age, and without children at home.  Many are students or active professionals who are passionate about, and make
                sure to find time for, their hobbies.  A balance would need to be found between a typical cloud storage platform,
                which can remind users of boring software at work, and the hi-gloss and often pandering commercialism of some of the
                larger streaming services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-right">
              <p class="user-research-p2">When asked what their current platform lacks, respondents to the survey admitted that they would like a design to
                look nicer or work better.  However, they didn’t necessarily have ideas or specific complaints.  It might be a situation
                of having no frame of reference, as most are using Google Drive because it’s free and they have little to compare it to,
                favorably or otherwise.  In terms of finding general barriers to cloud storage use, a significant - if not overwhelming -
                portion of respondents cited security concerns, or fear of losing access to their files.  I decided to build in a security
                feature, called “Collaborators,” which enables users to set privileges when sharing files, to help mitigate this concern.</p>

             <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>For our project, we decided to focus on appealing visuals in a way done successfully by Pinterest.
               We also were inspired by the clean, uncluttered functionality of Box’s dashboard and the unique organizing features of Evernote.
               We hoped to avoid the heavily curated content and ads of Pinterest, the somewhat boring though functional look of Box,
               and what might be perceived as the features overload of Evernote.</p>

                  When he does take time off, he makes the most of it by focusing on self-care, being active, and spending time with friends and family.  </p>
               <h4>Motivations</h4>
                <p>In order to do the best possible work and maintain the calm focus he needs to on the job, Tim schedules mental breaks.  He is a regular
                  at his local gym and yoga studio., and he likes to volunteer to act as DJ for his friends’ parties and events at local businesses.  He is
                  energized by being in a crowd full of people having fun..  He’s also a fan of beer and smoked meat, and overindulges now and then.  Tim
                  makes an effort to balance these nights out with rest, fitness and meditation.</p>

                  recordings of yoga classes, posted by his instructor, while on the road.</p>
               <h4>Frustrations</h4>
                <p>He can’t always get great wifi in hotels and airports, where he needs yoga most.  He’d like to have access to his
                  recordings offline for this reason.</p>

                          The artist related his opinion that searching by keywords in the information age maneuvers us around documents we might

                          <p class="testing-part-1-p1">Usability testing revealed that, although users dislike having to scroll to find call-to-action buttons, they really love scrolling
                            through an array of album cover images to find something to listen to.  People will comment that they often forget what they even have
                            in their collection, so removing the search field allows people to dive in and engage with the dusty corners of their libraries.</p>

                            right.  It ended up being an improvement to pair these buttons at the bottom of the screen, under the playback controls.  This placement
                            of call-to-action buttons in pairs could then be a repeating pattern throughout the design.  It was also determined to be more useful
                            to make the “Back” button more specific.</p>

                                <p class="logo-branding-p1">While the font pairing of Bungee and Cutive Mono works well for most areas of the site, usability testing revealed that we would require a third font to
                                  improve readability for long blocks of text - such as in the new artist/album info sheets I will discuss below, in the Usability Testing: Hi-Fi Mockups
                                  section.  For this purpose, K2D was introduced late in the project.</p>

                                <p class="logo-branding-p2">A mood board was created to capture the colors, textures, and vague ideas we were beginning to associate with the brand.  The main ideas were determined
                                  to be escapism, nostalgia, mystery, community, handmade, imperfection, and the private lives of dreams old and new.</p>

                                <p class="logo-branding-p3"> Icons were created that could be used in the place of cover art where applicable, such as a record icon for a custom playlist, a microphone for a voice
                                  recording or podcast, and musical notes for home or live recordings.  Please see the link below for more early visual content sketches.</p>

                                <p class="logo-branding-p4">The logo was devised to give a strong, ostentatious, nostalgic yet modern feeling to the brand.  It was about mixtapes, record collecting, and summers
                                  spent driving around in a used project car that was probably unsafe to operate.  Were we trying to recover a communal creative life that was somehow lost,
                                  or supplanted, with the rise of the information age?  Several strategies were tried before the 3D mixtape inspired design began to stand out in mind.</p>

                                  <p>Our first idea was to be as minimal in our content as possible, creating an open space for user creativity that was not interrupted by recommended
                                    listening or other ads.  This would allow the user to curate their own recordings as an expression of the self, which could then be shared carefully
                                    with others under a set of well-defined preconditions (collaborator status or otherwise).  Language might also be crafted to help users avoid feeling
                                    like all of this carefully built content might evaporate into thin air at any time.  Here are the headings which resulted from this train of thought:</p>

                                  <p>Please see the first digital iteration of the landing page.  Though it seems on the surface to meet all the requirements of a successful customer
                                   experience, some problems with this wireframe were quickly revealed in the first round of usability testing.  Firstly, the two main call-to-action buttons
                                   - to sign up for an account or log in to listen - were at first placed just below the hero image only, on the left.  Testing revealed that these buttons
                                   weren’t visible above the fold for all desktop screen resolutions.  The design was corrected to include call-to-action button sets at the top right of the
                                   landing page, directly on top of the hero image itself, and again at the bottom right corner of the landing page.  This strategy proved effective in testing
                                   with hi-fi mockups.</p>
                                 </div>

                                   <p>Another problem with the landing page design, which presented itself during the creation of hi-fi mockups, had to do with the layout of the static
                                     walkthrough of features.  This top portion of this area felt a bit unstable because of the fact that the compelling background texture did not span the
                                      width of the viewport.  Also, the space reserved for images depicting features in the rose-colored cascading boxes below was not large enough to
                                      present meaningful information to viewers.  Plus, the cascading of features boxes along a diagonal line implied a hierarchy that wasn’t really meaningful.</p>

                                   <p>These cascading features boxes were eventually replaced altogether by a large image of the library/dashboard, with arrows pointing the way to specific talking
                                    points.  These arrows can be animated to appear in a hover state, or on click of the related text, in a future version of the design. </p>

                                   <p>Additionally, elements which distracted from the plan information boxes in the center of the landing page were adjusted or removed.  Lastly, some changes
                                    were made in terms of color to aid in readability - and appeal to a wider audience.  Midnight blue proved to be a much more popular color choice than rose or light purple in preference tests, so appropriate changes were made.  </p>

                            <h3>Usability Testing Part 2</h3>
                              <p class="testing-round-2-p1">In a final round of testing with hi-fi mockups, a few more ideas presented themselves which have been incorporated into the current version of the design.
                                All users seemed to like the uncluttered look of the “Library” dashboard, which focuses on cover art displayed in a grid with plenty of surrounding white
                                space.  However, most wanted a way to get more information on each recording - such as the artist’s name, album title, and other details.</p>
                                <p>The main question was, how to include all of this text without destroying the popular clean feel of the interface?  An effective solution was arrived at when we placed modal
                                buttons on the selected album cover.  These modal buttons lead the viewer to an “Info” sheet on the artist/album, or to the “Notes” modal screen.</p>

                                <p class="testing-round-2-p2">One last concern raised in hi-fi prototype testing was a lack of information on the “Collaborator” privileges offered in the “Share” modal screen.
                                  Testers wanted to know what permissions were being granted when they shared a song or playlist with a collaborator.  To that end, a simple “?” button
                                  and associated info sheet were created.</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p class="conclusion-p1">In setting out to create a usable interface that would evoke a retro, independent bookstore style we ended up creating a clean
                              interface that feels current.  Not only are buttons visible and usable on top of images, but testers anticipate that buttons will
                              be there and actively seek them out.  If time allowed, we would take more care to eliminate the need to scroll to find buttons in
                              modal screens across all devices.  Also, a later iteration will need to address the problems created by having more than one
                              organizing function carried out in a single modal screen.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="text-right">
                            <p class="conclusion-p2"> When two processes are at play, and there is a “Back” button, which screen are we going back to exactly?  To reduce cognitive
                              load and the need to scroll, each of these organizing functions will either need to be isolated into their own modal screens -
                              or perhaps the “Category” option will need to be eliminated.  Until then, we risk creating frustration for customers by forcing
                              them back to the beginning of a two-step process every time they change their mind about how to organize their files.</p>

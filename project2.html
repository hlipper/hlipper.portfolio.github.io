  <h3 class="locket-h3">Summary</h3>
      <p class="locket-p">Locket is a web app that helps us set personal goals,
        track progress, and celebrate our everyday achievements. This self-contained system is free of the distractions,
        unsolicited opinions, and hasty judgments of the wider world online.  It doesn’t do more than it needs to, and shares nothing before we’re ready.
        It is a safe space where we can, over time, turn an everyday idea into something extraordinary.</p>

          <h3 class="locket-h3">Problem</h3>
            <p class="locket-p">In 2019, we have a mind-boggling array of tools for planning our daily lives, staying on task, and tracking our progress with personal goals.
              We can sync our Google Calendar with iCal, copy it all to our Trello account - and have all three platforms reminding us to do what we must do in
              life.  Why is it that we still fall behind, forget important things, and generally fail to meet our expectations for ourselves?  Is this the sort of problem that can be solved with an app?
              I came up with the idea for this product while battling my own difficulty completing projects.
              I have a hundred ideas for creative and self-improvement projects each year, but only a fraction of these are seen through to fruition.
              Surely others struggle with the same issue.  What is the root of the problem, and can it be adjusted for?
              I carried the entire project from the research phase through visual design, prototyping and testing.</p>

          <h3 class="locket-h3">Solution</h3>
            <p class="locket-p">When asked about the biggest barriers to accomplishing personal goals, people routinely cite the overwhelming, round-the-clock demands of work.  Everyone needs a way to completely detach from their
              workday in order to focus on personal projects.  Making personal work public too early in the creative process, as with social sharing, appears to have a
              detrimental effect as well.  It can be easy to internalize the criticisms of others, allow self-doubt to build, and abandon projects early and often.
              Locket solves these problems by operating independently of all other calendars, and by the absence of social sharing functionality.  When the app is in use,
              the user has no choice but to focus on themselves.  All other platforms are locked, and associated notifications are delayed during project hours.  </p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p class="user-research-p1">Almost everyone who participated in my survey wishes they had more time for personal creative projects.  Respondents are working on things like:</p>
            <blockquote class="locket-research-blockquote">
              <ul>
               <li>UX Design Projects</li>
               <li>Case Studies</li>
               <li>Fine Art</li>
               <li>Visual Design Work</li>
               <li>Illustrations</li>
               <li>Photography.</li>
              </ul>
             </blockquote>
             <p class="user-research-p2">When asked about the biggest obstacle they face, the vast majority of those surveyed cited their job.
               To a lesser degree, a lack of funds, general lack of free time and family obligations were also barriers to getting things done.</p>
           </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="user-research-p3">Many respondents also cited a lack of motivation, and frustration with their own skill level, as roadblocks to achieving
                  their goals. Very few considered social media to be the root of the problem. Yet, more than 90% of respondents felt they could benefit from an app that
                  delayed notifications – or locked their phone completely – during scheduled project hours.</p>
                  <p class="user-research-p4">Additionally, the vast majority of respondents did not care to have their achievements featured in a blog post,
                    or posted on an online forum.  They also would rather not waste time reading related articles.  This suggests that most people would prefer
                    to work on creative projects anonymously and independently – safe from unwanted criticism and other outside influences. </p>

             <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>Google is ubiquitous.  It’s where everyone goes to do just about anything, and all products are fully integrated into a collection of
                free tools with widespread appeal.  Google provides free services in exchange for user data.  The more free services they provide, the
                more information can be gathered on the habits and preferences of individual users.  This information can then be used to funnel targeted
                ads or other content to users.  The end result is a personalized experience across platforms such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps.
                Some users may find the endless data collection invasive, or the targeted content distracting - especially when trying to make time for personal goals. </p>
                </div>
              <div class="text-right">
              <p>Apple products are also everywhere you look, even though they are angled slightly toward the luxury market when compared to most Android or
                Google products.  Calendar, Reminders and Notes come preloaded with Apple devices, and are fully integrated with other applications by Apple.
                Again, these are essentially a collection of free tools with widespread appeal.  Everything you’ve ever scheduled, noted, or listed is stored
                somewhere for safe-keeping.  If you are interested in extra features, such as sketching, color coding, importing images etc., they already exist
                and only await your discovery.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text">
              <p>Trello is a project management platform, owned by Atlassian.  It is really aimed at team projects.  However, there is an interesting option available
                to create personal project tracking cards on boards, called “Life Goals.”  These boards allow you to pick a custom background image from Unsplash,
                sort of like a hero image for your projects.  These boards are separate from your shared, professional boards, and can be marked private.  Trello is
                taking the functionality of the Apple and Google products and allowing users to arrange things their own way, on art boards that are visually appealing
                and fun. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-right">
              <p>This in itself may be enough to make a user feel like they are in a non-work, customized creative space. Just the simple act of setting up
              the board may spark other creative ideas, help a user understand how they feel about their projects, or allow them to visualize the end result of their
              hard work. If a product can carve out a space away from anything work-related, which also minimizes or eliminates distractions, it might be useful.  The lower
                it is in cost, the more likely users will adapt to it.  A combination of functionality, privacy and style might encourage users to pay $5 per month.
                The UI should feel experimental and fun, and be the kind of space that encourages creativity.</p>

Although she believes that quality education for all is critical to our collective well-being, she often feels drained and even upset at the end of the day.  Lisa sometimes feels powerless to make a difference in her community, mostly due to school policies that restrict what and how she can teach in her own classroom.  She is considering learning to code in her free time, and may change careers if it goes well.  It can be hard to set aside time since she often takes her work home with her.</p>

<p>Jill is an accountant at a law firm.  After many years of traveling and trying to find herself, she is relieved to be back in her hometown and in a steady job.  She bought a house, and is proud of what she has done to fix it up so far.  Most of her old friends are busy raising kids, so she and her husband spend weekends gardening and cooking out.  In particular, the garden has really taken on a life of it’s own and must be tended to constantly.  Jill uses a spreadsheet to keep track of these tasks, but would love an option that is interactive or more efficient to use. </p>

                  <p class="user-flows-p1">Individual user flows were built around the concept of project cards.  All actions related to a given project take place on the card itself,
                    which can be flipped for details.  All project cards are visible on a scrollable, art board-like dashboard.  Because calendar views were favored
                    by my survey participants, one was created for this app as well - with all scheduled projects placed in a timeline, and linking back to the
                    project cards themselves with a click. </p>

                        creation and information about the app itself.  A lock screen was created, which would deploy during project hours and block notifications.  A celebratory
                        pop-up message was drafted to mark the completion of a project.</p>

                            <p class="logo-branding-p1">Colors and fonts were selected that would feel friendly and approachable to young women, as they are the target market.  After exploring a few simple logo concepts related to padlocks, lockets, keys and crystal balls, a simple heart-shaped locket with a padlock at the center won out.  A style guide was then created, and provided plenty of material for a vibrant design.  At the same time, an effort was made to limit options and keep things as flexible as possible.</p>

                              spent driving around in a used project car that was probably unsafe to operate.  Were we trying to recover a communal creative life that was somehow lost,
                              or supplanted, with the rise of the information age?  Several strategies were tried before the 3D mixtape inspired design began to stand out in mind.</p>

                          <p class="testing-part-1-p1">Usability testing revealed that, although users dislike having to scroll to find call-to-action buttons, they really love scrolling
                            through an array of album cover images to find something to listen to.  People will comment that they often forget what they even have
                            in their collection, so removing the search field allows people to dive in and engage with the dusty corners of their libraries.</p>

                            right.  It ended up being an improvement to pair these buttons at the bottom of the screen, under the playback controls.  This placement
                            of call-to-action buttons in pairs could then be a repeating pattern throughout the design.  It was also determined to be more useful
                            to make the “Back” button more specific.</p>

                                  <p>Our first idea was to be as minimal in our content as possible, creating an open space for user creativity that was not interrupted by recommended
                                    listening or other ads.  This would allow the user to curate their own recordings as an expression of the self, which could then be shared carefully
                                    with others under a set of well-defined preconditions (collaborator status or otherwise).  Language might also be crafted to help users avoid feeling
                                    like all of this carefully built content might evaporate into thin air at any time.  Here are the headings which resulted from this train of thought:</p>

                                <h3>Hi-Fi Mockups & Prototypes</h3>
                                  <p>Please see the first digital iteration of the landing page.  Though it seems on the surface to meet all the requirements of a successful customer
                                   experience, some problems with this wireframe were quickly revealed in the first round of usability testing.  Firstly, the two main call-to-action buttons
                                   - to sign up for an account or log in to listen - were at first placed just below the hero image only, on the left.  Testing revealed that these buttons
                                   weren’t visible above the fold for all desktop screen resolutions.  The design was corrected to include call-to-action button sets at the top right of the
                                   landing page, directly on top of the hero image itself, and again at the bottom right corner of the landing page.  This strategy proved effective in testing
                                   with hi-fi mockups.</p>
                                 </div>
                                 <div class="center-image">

                                   <p>Another problem with the landing page design, which presented itself during the creation of hi-fi mockups, had to do with the layout of the static
                                     walkthrough of features.  This top portion of this area felt a bit unstable because of the fact that the compelling background texture did not span the
                                      width of the viewport.  Also, the space reserved for images depicting features in the rose-colored cascading boxes below was not large enough to
                                      present meaningful information to viewers.  Plus, the cascading of features boxes along a diagonal line implied a hierarchy that wasn’t really meaningful.</p>

                                   <p>These cascading features boxes were eventually replaced altogether by a large image of the library/dashboard, with arrows pointing the way to specific talking
                                    points.  These arrows can be animated to appear in a hover state, or on click of the related text, in a future version of the design. </p>

                                   <p>Additionally, elements which distracted from the plan information boxes in the center of the landing page were adjusted or removed.  Lastly, some changes
                                    were made in terms of color to aid in readability - and appeal to a wider audience.  Midnight blue proved to be a much more popular color choice than rose or light purple in preference tests, so appropriate changes were made.  </p>

                              <p class="testing-round-2-p1">In a final round of testing with hi-fi mockups, a few more ideas presented themselves which have been incorporated into the current version of the design.
                                All users seemed to like the uncluttered look of the “Library” dashboard, which focuses on cover art displayed in a grid with plenty of surrounding white
                                space.  However, most wanted a way to get more information on each recording - such as the artist’s name, album title, and other details.</p>
                                <p>The main question was, how to include all of this text without destroying the popular clean feel of the interface?  An effective solution was arrived at when we placed modal
                                buttons on the selected album cover.  These modal buttons lead the viewer to an “Info” sheet on the artist/album, or to the “Notes” modal screen.</p>

                                <p class="testing-round-2-p2">One last concern raised in hi-fi prototype testing was a lack of information on the “Collaborator” privileges offered in the “Share” modal screen.
                                  Testers wanted to know what permissions were being granted when they shared a song or playlist with a collaborator.  To that end, a simple “?” button
                                  and associated info sheet were created.</p>

                            <p>I hope the latest version of the Locket productivity app is a peaceful, calming, private and fun space.
                              I hope it empowers young women to develop their ideas before sharing them with the world. Although products with charm and style
                              can evoke positive feelings and help spark creativity, building a UI that is decorative will prove to be as distracting as any other
                              online content. When navigating the complex web of emotions that come up while pursuing goals, users will benefit most from a platform
                              that is calming and functional.  In the end, Locket will have solved a problem if it steps back and allows the work of the users to shine through.</p>
